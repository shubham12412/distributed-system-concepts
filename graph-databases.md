Graph databases

Graph databases represent data as a graphâ€”a network of nodes and edges that connect the nodes. Both nodes and edges 
can have properties. Because they give heightened importance to relationships, graph databases such as FlockDB, Neo4J, 
and Polyglot have proven popular for building social networking and semantic web applications.
