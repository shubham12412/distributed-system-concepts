Key-value stores

In a key-value store, the data items are keys that have a set of attributes. All data relevant to a key is stored with the 
key; data is frequently duplicated. Popular key-value stores include Amazonâ€™s Dynamo DB, Riak, and Voldemort. Additionally,
many popular caching technologies act as key-value stores, including Oracle Coherence, Redis, and MemcacheD.
