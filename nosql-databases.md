For a comprehensive list of NoSQL databases, see the site http://nosql-database.org.

There is wide variety in the goals and features of these databases, but they tend to share a set of common characteristics. 

1) The most obvious of these is implied by the name NoSQLâ€”these databases support data models, data definition languages (DDLs), and ***interfaces beyond the standard SQL available*** in popular relational databases. 

2) In addition, these databases are typically ***distributed systems without centralized control***. 

3) They ***emphasize horizontal scalability and high availability***, in some cases ***at the cost of strong consistency and ACID semantics***. 

4) They tend to support rapid development and deployment. They take ***flexible approaches to schema definition***, in some cases not requiring any schema to be defined up front. 

5) They provide support for Big Data and analytics use cases.
