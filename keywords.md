18) Elastic Scalability,  vertical scaling, horizontally scale, horizontal scalability, elastically scalable, ability to scale to a very large number of machines, 

---Scalability is an architectural feature of a system that can continue serving a greater number of requests with little degradation in performance.

---Vertical scaling—simply adding more hardware capacity and memory to your existing machine—is the easiest way to achieve this. 

---Horizontal scaling means adding more machines that have all or some of the data on them so that no one machine has to bear the entire burden of serving requests. But then the software itself must have an internal mechanism for keeping its data in sync with the other nodes in the cluster

---Elastic scalability refers to a special property of horizontal scalability. It means that your cluster can seamlessly scale up and scale back down. To do this, the cluster must be able to accept new nodes that can begin participating by getting a copy of some or all of the data and start serving new user requests without major disruption or reconfiguration of the entire cluster. You don’t have to restart your process. You don’t have to change your application queries. You don’t have to manually rebalance the data yourself. Just add another machine—Cassandra will find it and start sending it work.

21) SHARDING AND SHARED-NOTHING ARCHITECTURE,  auto-sharding, 

22)  master/slave  - in a master/slave setup, the master can become a single point of failure (SPOF). To avoid this, you often need to add some complexity to the environment in the form of multiple masters.
