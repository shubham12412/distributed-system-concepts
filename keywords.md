18) Elastic Scalability,  vertical scaling, horizontally scale, horizontal scalability, elastically scalable, ability to scale to a very large number of machines, 

---Scalability is an architectural feature of a system that can continue serving a greater number of requests with little degradation in performance.

---Vertical scaling—simply adding more hardware capacity and memory to your existing machine—is the easiest way to achieve this. 

---Horizontal scaling means adding more machines that have all or some of the data on them so that no one machine has to bear the entire burden of serving requests. But then the software itself must have an internal mechanism for keeping its data in sync with the other nodes in the cluster

21) SHARDING AND SHARED-NOTHING ARCHITECTURE,  auto-sharding, 

22)  master/slave  - in a master/slave setup, the master can become a single point of failure (SPOF). To avoid this, you often need to add some complexity to the environment in the form of multiple masters.
